	•	Square Footage
	•	Number of Bedrooms
	•	Number of Bathrooms

💻 Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	NumPy
	•	Pandas
	•	Scikit-learn
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

📊 Dataset

A sample dataset was generated containing housing attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms along with price.
